# Netflix-Movies-And-Tv-Show-Clustering

This project involves an analysis of a dataset containing information on movies and TV shows available on Netflix as of 2019. Using unsupervised machine learning techniques, such as clustering algorithms, the project aims to identify patterns and groupings within the data to gain insights into the trends and characteristics of content on Netflix.

# Understanding Business problem

The business problem at the heart of this unsupervised machine learning project is to gain insights into the trends and patterns of content on Netflix, and to use those insights to improve the user experience and drive business growth. The challenge for Netflix is to make sense of the vast amount of content in their library and to provide their users with a personalized and engaging viewing experience. By applying unsupervised machine learning techniques such as clustering to the dataset, the company can identify meaningful patterns and groupings within the data, which can then be used to inform decisions about content creation, marketing, and user interface design. For instance, Netflix can use these insights to promote new releases to users who have previously watched similar titles or to recommend content to users who have shown a preference for certain genres. Ultimately, by leveraging the power of unsupervised machine learning, Netflix can gain a deeper understanding of their content library and their users' preferences, and use this knowledge to drive business growth and customer satisfaction.

# Problem Statement

This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine. In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming serviceâ€™s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset.
